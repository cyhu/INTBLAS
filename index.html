      <h2>

      </h2>
      <p>
        IntBox is an object-oriented interval basic linear algebra subroutines
        (BLAS) package in C++. The major reference for the design and
        implementation of this package is the proposed interval BLAS standard.
        The library consists of arithmetic, algebraic, utility functions, and
        set operations among intervals, interval vectors and interval
        matrices. These operations are implemented as methods of the seven
        template classes in this library. The template class IntervalVector is
        used for all vector operations. As per the standard there are six
        different matrix classes: IntervalMatrix, TriIntervalMatrix,
        SymIntervalMatrix, BandedIntervalMatrix, TriBandedIntervalMatrix and
        SymBandedIntervalMatrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        The package is designed to be portable, well-tested, and robust with
        built-in error handling features. It can be easily embedded into an
        ANSI/ISO C++ environment to enable interval software development.
        Instructions on package installation, testing, usage, and sample
        applications are included below.

      <h3>
        Boost
      </h3>
      <p>
        IntBox makes use of Boost's interval_lib library to provide the basic
        interval operations. Their are many good quality interval libraries
        out there, but we chose boost for a several of reasons. First, the
        Boost License is very flexible. This allows us to distribute the
        interval_lib library without having to distribute all of the much
        larger Boost package. Second, Boost is cross-platform compatible,
        which is one of the prime goals of the IntBox library. Lastly, Boost's
        interval library seems to be the most compatible with the proposed
        standard C++ interval class. Our plan is to eventually use the
        standard interval class when it made widely available. This means that
        when the change does occur it can be done with a minimum of effort.
      </p>

        <a name="install" id="install">Installation</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The library is easy to install. The installation procedures outlined
        here have been tested using GCC on Ubuntu Linux, and on Windows using
        Microsoft Visual Studio .Net.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="vs" id="vs">Visual Studio</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        For quite a while we were issuing a binary installer to use with
        Visual Studio. But do to Microsoft putting out a new edition every
        couple of years and our researchers differing versions, we decided it
        was to difficult to take into account all the various version. So the
        installation is now done by hand.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the zip file.
        </li>
        <li>Locate the installation directory for you edition of Visual
        Studio. This directory can usually be found by first going to the <tt>
          Program Files</tt> directory. The directory's name changes with each
          different version of Visual Studio, it is usually begins with
          "Microsoft Visual Studio" and then is suffixed with a version number
          or a year number.
        </li>
        <li>You will need to copy the contents of the <tt>src</tt> directory
        to the <tt>vc/include</tt> directory which is within the Visual Studio
        install directory.
        </li>
        <li>You can also copy the <tt>doc</tt> directory to a convenient
        place.
        </li>
        <li>To uninstall the library, just delete the files you copied.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        <a name="gcc" id="gcc">Linux/Unix using GCC</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        To install this library you will need <code>GCC</code> and
        <code>make</code>. By default the header files are installed in
        <tt>/usr/include</tt>, and the documentation is installed in
        <tt>/usr/share/doc/IntBox-1.0</tt>. If these are not the paths you
        desire then you can make the appropriate changes to the configuration
        section of the <tt>Makefile</tt>. <b>Note, you will need root
        permissions to install in the default location.</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a console
        </li>
        <li>Go to the package's <tt>gcc</tt> folder
        </li>
        <li>Type <code>make install</code> This will copy the header files to
        the compiler's include directory. By installing this library, the
        Boost interval_lib library is also installed. If you already have
        boost installed, that installation will not be overwritten.
        </li>
        <li>If you wish to create the testing application, type <code>make
        test</code> to create it.
        </li>
        <li>To uninstall the package type <code>make uninstall</code> Note,
        the uninstaller will not remove the Boost interval_lib library.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        <a name="port" id="port">Other Platforms</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The above installation procedures can be used on the platforms we use
        for testing. The library is tested using Ubuntu Linux 6.1, and Windows
        XP. If you wish to run the library on another system or using another
        compiler, the easiest way is probably to edit the <em>Makefile</em>
        for GCC to have it use your compiler and installation paths.
        Alternatively, you can simply copy the files and folders in the
        <tt>src</tt> folder to your project's or compiler's include directory.
        The code itself is written in ANSI/ISO standard C++, therefore as long
        as your compiler is fairly standards compliant, the code should
        function without error. Next, you will need to know if the library
        works. This is the purpose for including the unit tests with the
        distribution. If you are not using the <em>Makefile</em>, then simply
        build and link all the files found in the test directory into one
        executable.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a name="tester" id="tester">Testing The Library</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        You can run the standard test cases for the library using the packaged
        tester application. For Visual Studio, simply open the solution file
        in the <tt>msvc</tt> folder. Then compile and run. On Unix like
        systems. Simply execute <code>make test</code> in the <tt>gcc</tt>
        folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The test application is used to run the standard test cases. The
        application is console based. From the appropriate directory type
        <code>test -h</code> for a listing of the available options.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a name="tester-app" id="tester-app">The Tester</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The application itself is a simple command line program. The tester
        simply outputs whether a test passes or fails. As mentioned there are
        149 individual test cases. To make it simpler to observe the test
        result the output is split into two parts. First, is a category based
        output, this simply reports what category of tests is being worked and
        how many errors resulted. The second output reports on the pass/fail
        status of each test case. This output is very verbose, hence it is
        recommended that it be placed in a separate file. The <tt>-v</tt> and
        <tt>-m</tt> switches allow one to test only the vector or matrix
        classes. If these are the only switches used then a short test is
        performed. However, either of the next two switches causes the tester
        to go into <em>long</em> test mode. In long test mode the tester
        repetitively performs different test cases using different matrices.
        The <tt>-r</tt> switch specifies the number of repetitions, and the
        <tt>-d</tt> switch specifies the maximum size of the vectors and
        matrices to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <code>&gt; test -v -m dump.txt</code>
          <br>
          This will cause the IntervalVector and IntervalMatrix classes to be
          tested and the output will be written to the file dump.txt, further
          the long tests will be skipped.
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>&gt; test -r 40 -m</code>
          <br>
          This will perform a long test where many of the cases will be tested
          forty times using different matrices, whose dimensions range from
          five twenty. Furthermore, all of the output will be printed on the
          screen.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>
        <a name="port-test" id="port-test">Portability Testing</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Portability tests are carried out by executing the tester on targeted
        platforms. The library has been tested on two processors, and three
        operating systems. It was mainly developed using Windows on an Intel
        Core Duo processor, using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET and GCC 3.4.4
        running under CygWin. The library was also tested on Ubuntu Linux 6.1
        on an Intel Pentium 4M using GCC 4.1.2.
